Features and enhancements

- #989200 - Support "dynamic" migrations. Changes to be aware of:

    (see migrate_migrate_api() for an example).

  Migration class names are no longer required to end in 'Migration'.

File destinations (i.e., migrating directly to the file_managed table, with
  optional copying of the files themselves) are now supported.
Allow migration of comment enable/disable.
Check max_execution_time as well as memory_limit, for graceful exit when
  max_execution_time is in play.
